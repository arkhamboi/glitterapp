<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Is this club only for LGBTQAI individuals?</li>
			<p>Not necessarily. Although, while many people consider themselves allies, and we want allies to have fun with their LGBTQAI pals, our main concern is to provide a fun and safe nightclub specifically for LGBTQAI individuals. The FOCUS is on them, not our allies, and we think that's perfectly okay, in context.</p>
		<li>Do you host drag shows? Don't you consider that offensive?</li>
			<p>We do host them. We don't think that drag is necessarily offensive. Like any art form, there may be problematic aspects of it, but we find that many individuals use it as a medium to express themselves. We are a club that almost doubles as a community center. Drag shows are hosted every Thursday night. If you don't like drag or would prefer not to see it performed, the rest of the week is drag-show-free.</p>
		<li>Some of your employees are called 'hosts'? What are they? Are you hiring hosts?</li>
			<p>They sure are! Hosts are exactly what you'd expect at a party at home- who ever is throwing the party makes sure the guests' needs are met and that they're having a good time. In Glitter's case, hosts are representatives of the club, itself, and make sure our club is providing you with titilating conversation, exceptional drinks, and swinging music. If you're approached by someone you don't know and they make friendly conversation and ask you what you're drinking and if they can get you another one on the house, it's probably one of our hosts! Check their collar for a nametag! And, yes, we are always accepting applications for hosts!</p>
		<li>Can I bring my dog/cat/parrot/snake/koala inside?</li>
			<p>We've had people sneak their animal friends in before. Trust us, though, while it's all well and good to want to spend quality time with an animal friend, Glitter does NOT recommend your furry/feathered/scaly friend party in our club environment. While the flashing lights, sick beats, alcohol, and sweaty dancing may be good for you, we do not endorse it for your friends. :( Sorry!</p>
